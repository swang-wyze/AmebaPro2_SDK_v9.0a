Example Description

This example describes how to use GPIO read/write mbed api to generate a pulse and to measure the pulse width.

Requirement Components:
    a wire

Pin name PA_3 and PE_0 map to GPIOA_3 and GPIOE_0:
    1, PA_3 as the interrupt GPIO pin with no pull (High-Z).
    2, PE_0 as output to generate a pulse.
    3, Use a wire to connect PE_1 and PE_0 

In this example, the UART console will print out the measured width (in us) of the pulse which generated by the interrupt GPIO pin.
